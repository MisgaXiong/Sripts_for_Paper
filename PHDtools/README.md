**The PHDtools platform is a graphical user interface (GUI) based intranet online platform. Computers in the same LAN could access this platfrom by visiting the intranet IP address of the work station which installed with PHDtools.**

## Introduction
**PHDtools is an intranet online platform that can process the mNGS/NGS data of pathogen genomes. This platform is helpful for the labs and the frontliner workers who have limited background in bioinformatics. Briefly, PHDtools have a total of 15 functions.**

Core functions:
```
1. Pathogen X Identification (mNGS data analysis)
2. Target Pathogen Genome Assembly (De novo assemble the pathogen genome)
3. Intra-host Variation Identification (Identify within-host minor alleles)
4. Inter-host Variation Identification (Identify mutations including SNP and Indel between two isolates)
5. Lineage-level Variation Identification (Identify common mutations at the lineage-level of the pathogen)
```
Other functions:
```
1. Reverse or Complement of the Sequences
2. Translate Nucleotide Sequences to Amino Acide Sequences
3. Extact the target sequences
4. Translate Nucleotide Sequences to Amino Acid Sequences
5. Genome Annotation
6. Evaluation of Sequencing Quality
7. Phylegenetic Strain Typing
8. Genome Annotation
9 Identification of Conserved Regions of the Pathogen
10. PCR-primers Mapping
```
